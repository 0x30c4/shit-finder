# Shit-finder

A simple command line file finder made with python.
It finds file in the current directory.And also all the sub-directory's of that directory.

To use this as a terminal command in MacOs or in Linux add this line to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.<br>
<code>alias shitfinder='python3 ~/../../shit_finder.py'</code>

For windows make a .exe file from the shit_finder.py and add the path of that file to your path variable.
